Chose to use one sensor or the other.\n\n  Setting the correct WHITE_THRESHOLD value is key to stopping correctly.\n  This should be set half way between the light and dark values.\n  These values can be read on the screen once the OpMode has been INIT, but before it is STARTED.\n  Move the senso on asnd off the white line and not the min and max readings.\n  Edit this code to make WHITE_THRESHOLD half way between the min and max.\n\n\n ",

        "description": "{@link SensorBNO055IMUCalibration} calibrates the IMU accelerometer per\n\"Section 3.11 Calibration\" of the BNO055 specification.\n\n<p>Manual calibration of the IMU is definitely NOT necessary: except for the magnetometer\n(which is not used by the default {@link BNO055IMU.SensorMode#IMU\nSensorMode#IMU}), the BNO055 is internally self-calibrating and thus can be very successfully\nused without manual intervention. That said, performing a one-time calibration, saving the\nresults persistently, then loading them again at each run can help reduce the time that automatic\ncalibration requires.</p>\n\n<p>This summary of the calibration process, from <a href=\"http://iotdk.intel.com/docs/master/upm/classupm_1_1_b_n_o055.html\">\nIntel</a>, is informative:</p>\n\n<p>\"This device requires calibration in order to operate accurately. [...] Calibration data is\nlost on a power cycle. See one of the examples for a description of how to calibrate the device,\nbut in essence:</p>\n\n<p>There is a calibration status register available [...] that returns the calibration status\nof the accelerometer (ACC), magnetometer (MAG), gyroscope (GYR), and overall system (SYS).\nEach of these values range from 0 (uncalibrated) to 3 (fully calibrated). Calibration [ideally]\ninvolves certain motions to get all 4 values at 3. The motions are as follows (though see the\ndatasheet for more information):</p>\n\n<li>\n    <ol>GYR: Simply let the sensor sit flat for a few seconds.</ol>\n    <ol>ACC: Move the sensor in various positions. Start flat, then rotate slowly by 45\n             degrees, hold for a few seconds, then continue rotating another 45 degrees and\n             hold, etc. 6 or more movements of this type may be required. You can move through\n             any axis you desire, but make sure that the device is lying at least once\n             perpendicular to the x, y, and z axis.</ol>\n    <ol>MAG: Move slowly in a figure 8 pattern in the air, until the calibration values reaches 3.</ol>\n    <ol>SYS: This will usually reach 3 when the other items have also reached 3. If not, continue\n             slowly moving the device though various axes until it does.\"</ol>\n</li>\n\n<p>To calibrate the IMU, run this sample opmode with a gamepad attached to the driver station.\nOnce the IMU has reached sufficient calibration as reported on telemetry, press the 'A'\nbutton on the gamepad to write the calibration to a file. That file can then be indicated\nlater when running an opmode which uses the IMU.</p>\n\n<p>Note: if your intended uses of the IMU do not include use of all its sensors (for exmaple,\nyou might not use the magnetometer), then it makes little sense for you to wait for full\ncalibration of the sensors you are not using before saving the calibration data. Indeed,\nit appears that in a SensorMode that doesn't use the magnetometer (for example), the\nmagnetometer cannot actually be calibrated.</p>\n\n@see AdafruitBNO055IMU\n@see BNO055IMU.Parameters#calibrationDataFile\n@see <a href=\"https://www.bosch-sensortec.com/bst/products/all_products/bno055\">BNO055 product page</a>\n@see <a href=\"https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_14.pdf\">BNO055 specification</a>\n ",

        "description": "This sample illustrates using the rumble feature of many gamepads.\n\nNote: Some gamepads \"rumble\" better than others.\n  The Xbox & PS4 have a left (rumble1) and right (rumble2) rumble motor.\n  These two gamepads have two distinct rumble modes: Large on the left, and small on the right\n  The ETpark gamepad may only respond to rumble1, and may only run at full power.\n  The Logitech F310 gamepad does not haveany* rumble ability.\n\n  Moral:  You should use this sample to experiment with your specific gamepads to explore their rumble features.\n\nThe rumble motors are accessed through the standard gamepad1 and gamepad2 objects.\n  Several new methods were added to the Gamepad class in FTC SDK Rev 7\n  The key methods are as follows:\n\n  .rumble(double rumble1, double rumble2, int durationMs)\n    This method sets the rumble power of both motors for a specific time duration.\n    Both rumble arguments are motor-power levels in the 0.0 to 1.0 range.\n    durationMs is the desired length of the rumble action in milliseconds.\n    This method returns immediately.\n    Note:\n      Use a durationMs of Gamepad.RUMBLE_DURATION_CONTINUOUS to provide a continuous rumble\n      Use a power of 0, or duration of 0 to stop a rumble.\n\n  .rumbleBlips(int count) allows an easy way to signal the driver with a series of rumble blips.\n    Just specify how many blips you want.\n    This method returns immediately.\n\n  .runRumbleEffect(customRumbleEffect) allows you to run a custom rumble sequence that you have\n    built using the Gamepad.RumbleEffect.Builder()\n    A \"custom effect\" is a sequence of steps, where each step can rumble any of the\n    rumble motors for a specific period at a specific power level.\n    The Custom Effect will play as the (un-blocked) OpMode continues to run\n\n  .isRumbling() returns true if there is a rumble effect in progress.\n    Use this call to prevent stepping on a current rumble.\n\n  .stopRumble()              Stop any ongoing rumble or custom rumble effect.\n\n  .rumble(int durationMs)    Full power rumble for fixed duration.\n\n  Note: Whenever a new Rumble command is issued, any currently executing rumble action will\n  be truncated, and the new action started immediately.  Take these precautions:\n     1) Do Not SPAM the rumble motors by issuing rapid fire commands\n     2) Multiple sources for rumble commands must coordinate to avoid tromping on each other.\n\n  This can be achieved several possible ways:\n  1) Only having one source for rumble actions\n  2) Issuing rumble commands on transitions, rather than states.\n     e.g. The moment a touch sensor is pressed, rather than the entire time it is being pressed.\n  3) Scheduling rumble commands based on timed events. e.g. 10 seconds prior to endgame\n  4) Rumble on non-overlapping mechanical actions. e.g. arm fully-extended or fully-retracted.\n  5) Use isRumbling() to hold off on a new rumble if one is already in progress.\n\nThe examples shown here are representstive of how to invoke a gamepad rumble.\nIt is assumed that these will be modified to suit the specific robot and team strategy needs.\n\n########   Read the telemetry display on the Driver Station Screen for instructions.   ######\n\nEx 1)    This example shows a) how to create a custom rumble effect, and then b) how to trigger it based\n         on game time.  One use for this might be to alert the driver that half-time or End-game is approaching.\n\nEx 2)    This example shows tying the rumble power to a changing sensor value.\n         In this case it is the Gamepad trigger, but it could be any sensor output scaled to the 0-1 range.\n         Since it takes over the rumble motors, it is only performed when the Left Bumper is pressed.\n         Note that this approach MUST include a way to turn OFF the rumble when the button is released.\n\nEx 3)    This example shows a simple way to trigger a 3-blip sequence.  In this case it is\n         triggered by the gamepad A (Cross) button, but it could be any sensor, like a touch or light sensor.\n         Note that this code ensures that it only rumbles once when the input goes true.\n\nEx 4)    This example shows how to trigger a single rumble when an input value gets over a certain value.\n         In this case it is reading the Right Trigger, but it could be any variable sensor, like a\n         range sensor, or position sensor.  The code needs to ensure that it is only triggered once, so\n         it waits till the sensor drops back below the threshold before it can trigger again.\n\nUse Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.\nRemove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list.\n ",
